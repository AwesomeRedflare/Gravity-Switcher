# Gravity Switcher
 
This is Gravity Switcher. A game made for the GeoJam 2021 hosted by Icoso. This game jam lasted a week and had the theme of SWITCH along side the main theme of using geometrics shapes hence the name geojam.

In my entry, you play as a circle that has to get to the flat icosohedron I.E. the goal by switching the gravity in counterclockwise order (right, up, left, down). Once you can get good enough, you can try to speerun it because I added an ingame speedrun timer, and since the game is quite short (6 levels) the game can be beaten in less than a minute!

Somehow my game got 1st in gameplay and 6th place overall and was even showcased in Icoso's video.
